	<h2 style="color: #50A0FF;" > <a name ="ME"> What I Like </a> </h2> 
	<p style="color: #4080FF;"> To start off, I will put here what kind of music I enjoy. I listen primarily to metal.
My favorite bands are Amorphis, Children of Bodom, Death, Dissection, Sodom, Immortal, and Burzum. Other bands that I also like a lot are Metallica, Slayer, DRI, Misfits, Broken Bones, Charged GBH, Tool, Alice in Chains,
Pantera, Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, and Led Zeppelin.
I used to listen to a lot of 90's demoscene music as well, and while I don't listen to it as much nowadays, I still listen to some of it on occasion.
There is no denying that there are many talented musicians who created music in the demoscene.</p>

	<h2 style="color: #A050FF;" > <a name ="RESK"> Resonating Skies </a> </h2> 
	<p style="color: #8040FF;"> I created a Dark Ambient demo a while back using my guitar, my bass, my amps, various pedals, and several strange recorded sound effects.
I did all the sound editing in Audacity, and while it isn't the nicest sounding demo, I still like it a lot. </p>
<p style="color: #8040FF;"> The first song, Hypnotic Terror, is mostly comprised of sounds of me scraping my multi-tool across my guitar strings, then adding lots of echo in post production.</p>
<p style="color: #8040FF;"> The next one, Incandescence features more technical guitar parts, and some improvised parts in the middle and end of the song.</p>
<p style="color: #8040FF;"> Numinous is a recording of me improvising fingerstyle in one take, although there was at least one riff that I played before, so it's not entirely improvised.</p>
<p style="color: #8040FF;"> The title track starts with me playing my bass and using a wah pedal and fuzz pedal, and adding lots of echo in post.
There is also a reversed bassline playing in the background throughout the beginning. </p>
<p style="color: #8040FF;"> The fifth track, Deep Down Under, starts off with a riff I came up with on the spot, and the background noise is the sound I recorded from my phone while on a subway, but slowed down and echoed.
The guitar parts after that were all improvised.</p>
<p style="color: #8040FF;"> Augmented Ions is me improvising with a very strange tuning on my guitar while also using a fuzz pedal and flanger pedal. The tuning used was (in order from low string to high.) F# A B F# B E </p>
<p style="color: #8040FF;"> Waiting out the Storm is my favorite track. It is the first one I started, even though I finished Hypnotic Terror first, the same night in fact.
I recorded some guitar screeches then pitch shifted and super echoed them to get that psychedelic thunder that plays the first couple of minutes.
I have numerous strange samples in this song, from my sister's dog growling into my mic, to me cutting paper with scissors. The ending riff was recorded on the spot, and I was initially going to stop there,
but I thought a cool wah solo would be good to go with it, so I recorded it in a single take, and applied the wah in post processing. </p>
