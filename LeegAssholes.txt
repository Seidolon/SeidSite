Assholes on League of Legends 
If you see these fuckers anywhere, GIVE 'EM HELL. 
- 7angryllamas. Harassed and bullied me then told the entire team to report me, all because I wanted to surrender early.
- braydonj. Asshole blames me for a shitty game and refuses to believe that I actually have lag issues. 
- KingLucifer1221. Made fun of my Tryndamere skin and threatened to report me. 
- Fabulous Freya. Calls me brain dead even though he KS'd the living shit outta me while he was supposed to be supporting. 
- TaTas On Fire. Hypocrite scumbag who needs to realize that having a bad game doesn't mean you suck. 
- Arteer. Bitchy hypocrite who called me out for dying, and got butthurt and afk'd when I did the same to him. 
- Flamarada Dimon. Got mad at me for not going in and dying, then left bot lane and cost us game.
- Sasukevqs. Went 1/11 and told me that I was the reason we lost and that he was doing his job but not me. I was 5/6 btw.
- collidin. Toxic piece of shit. That's all that needs to be said. Sore winner and all-around douchebag.
- hendawg14. Calls me a faggot then proceeds to play dumb as to how he is toxic.
- darkNemm. Worst support I've ever seen. Takes TP, gets me 1 kill, then leaves bot and roams around the map. Lost us bot lane inevitably.
- Arinalla. Trash support. Takes all the kills then tells me I suck. Dodge if you see this person in champ select.
- Lx3Leonos. Got mad because the other team banned pyke and because I called him an idiot. He was gonna int-feed but luckily yas was afk so we remade.
- didko123. toxic smurfing piece of shit. got butthurt cause i said "?" once so he spammed it to me all game, then in post game made fun of how i lost 3 games in a row previously.
- EcstAsy EMP. Gets fed with zed and proceeds to act like he's a "bad mothafucka" and calls out rest of the team for being "trash". Can't be more than 12 years old.

As Draven ADC, do not accept these support champs:
- ZYRA (KS's all the kills every time)
- VEL'KOZ (Just a really bad support champ)
- VEIGAR (Takes kills and ends up carrying the lane)
- BRAND (All of my brand supps are trash and enemy's are always gods)
- HEIMER (Just a troll pick for support)
